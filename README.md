# Exercise 0x00
Write a function `findMax` that takes three integers as input and returns the maximum among them.
Write a test that calls the `findMax` function and prints the result to the console.

# Exercise 0x01
Implement a function `calculateFactorial` that computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
Write a test that calls the `calculateFactorial` function and prints the result to the console.

# Exercise 0x02
Define overloaded functions to calculate the area of a rectangle, a circle, and a triangle.

Each function should have different parameters, here are some hints
- `width` and `height` for a rectangle
- The number pi is available in the `<cmath>` library as `M_PI`
- Check out Heron's formula for triangles

Write a test in `main` that calls each function and prints the result to the console.

# Exercise 0x03
Extract one (or more) function(s) from the code below, that makes the program more comprehensible.

```c++
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  
  double v, r;

  std::cout << "This program calculates the power dissipated in a simple resistor circuit" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Input the power source voltage [V]: " << std::endl;
  std::cin >> v;
  std::cout << "Input the resistance R [Ohm]: " << std::endl;
  std::cin >> r;

  double power = pow(v, 2) / r;

  std::cout << "The power dissipated in R is " << power << "watts [W]" << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```
